# Jekyll-Relative-Bootstrap

Jekyll from Server to File Manager to Dropbox - Relative Links, Relative URI's

## Usage & History

For all usage and documentation please see: <http://jekyllbootstrap.com>, this is just a fork of that project.

It started with this Stack Overflow question: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7985081/how-to-deploy-a-jekyll-site-locally-with-css-js-and-background-images-included>

I wanted a way to host a website on a shared network folder at work.  This is the result of that.  Please fork, issue requests and do whatever you can to improve this.  It is just a start.

## Purpose

The files generated can be hosted on a web server, on a local folder or in your dropbox shared folder.  The dropbox folder acted funny with some of the link sharing, and that is why there are extra slashes in paths.  It would be nice to eliminate these slashes at some point.

## Other Projects

Middleman is a great static website generator, however getting it to do this was too tricky and inconsistent.

Webby and Webgen do this but they have not been updated for a couple of years.

Pith does this very nicely, however it has no instructions to push to Heroku, and I could not find examples of other sites that have been built with it besides that of the programmer.

Sphinx Document Generator does this awesomely, however it is not as elegant to theme and design with.  That being said, Sphinx is incredible.

Nesta CMS is powerful and can probably do this statically, however it doesnt have a good twitter bootstrap theme yet.

If you have any suggestions for other projects that would accomplish this better please let me know.
